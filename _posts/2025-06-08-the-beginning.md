I've been meaning to write more for an eternity now. To rub salt, I have a few half-baked posts lying around, and a lot more ideas that I haven't even started on. It seemed I never had the time to get around to it---that is, until now.

No better time than a vacation to start, right?

So, here we are, with a new post, and a plan: I promise to put down something every three days. It needn't be long, but it should be something I can look back on and say, "Hey, I wrote that!" with hopefully not much embarrassment.

I hope to pen (or keyboard?) down:

- topics in computer science that I find particularly interesting
- topics in math that I find more elegant than usual
- hopefully some science too, when I finally get around to studying some physics and biochemistry
- thoughts on how to do computer science research, apply to grad school, and all that
- novels and books I read, and what I thought of them---both sci-fi/crime fiction and how-to-live-your-life non-fiction
- Some experiences and random stuff from my life, since life is way more than just computer science
- ```case default```

Good. Now I'll have to write for sure, since otherwise the white space not far below this post will make me quite the joke. Cheers. New post due on 06/11.
