Identity change. That helps motivate you.

The four things: cue, craving, response, reward. In terms of coffee in the morning.

Clear clues/cues. Environment is super key. You will do what is convenient automatically.

Implementation intentions: exactly how you'll do it. Increases accountability and reduces uncertainty/the need to make any choices at runtime.

A warning: setbacks and challenges will happen; take it with a growth mindset.

Let's face it: humans are intrinsically tied to the prospect/anticipation of reward. We are reward-seeking creatures. Dopamine, blah blah. You can use this to your advantage.

An interesting thing: even the thought of reward releases similar amounts of dopamine as the actual reward. This is why anticipation is so powerful. Watch Netflix only when exercising: you anticipate the reward of Netflix when the thought of exercising comes up, and do it. This is a form of temptation bundling/positive association. Key is to make it enjoyable by linking it to something you already love/do (habit chaining).
