This is essentially a reminder for me hehe. And a super-simple way to force accountability to get writing done. Oh, and no, it isn't the summary of a new machine-learning paper proposing an alternative to transformers to create intelligent beings (although it does do so). Cutting to the chase here.

That a person must be "disciplined" to achieve interesting things is as trite as the sunrise, yet as enduringly true as the dawn itself (Thanks Copilot, that was a lovely phrase). The vagueness of the word is often exploited by pop-culture. 
*"The Rock’s Discipline Is the Secret to His Success"* glamorously glosses over the specifics of his training, resources, and support system, and instead attributing everything to the catch-all term "discipline." The statement isn't wrong, per se, but without details leads to a pretty terrible understanding of the word: for example, someone might believe that simply "being disciplined"—without structure, feedback, or support—should guarantee success, and feel inadequate or confused when reality proves otherwise.
