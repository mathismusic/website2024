Hello! I'm Krishna Agaram, a senior at IIT Bombay pursuing a BTech with Honors in Computer Science. I enjoy theoretical CS, quantum computing, pure math, applications of reinforcement learning, and the occasional dev project. Outside of technical interests, I love hiking, running, badminton, science fiction, psychology, and music (I play the piano and am trying to drum). I'm always looking to learn new things and meet new people, so feel free to connect if any of the above topics interest you too (or even if not)!

My [CV](/assets/cv-oct24.pdf) and [Github](https://github.com/mathismusic).

P.S. this website is a stub and is mostly a placeholder for now. A few old blog entries on the home page, that's all. More to come soon!
